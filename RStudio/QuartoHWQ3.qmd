## Question 3

**Data includes 6 states bordering the U.S. including:**

-   Baja California

-   Sonora

-   Chihuahua

-   Coahuila

-   Nuevo León

-   Tamaulipas

```{r}

#Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

#Import tortilla data csv file
tortilla_prices_data <- read.csv("/Users/giannadelorenzo/Downloads/STAT 184/tortilla_data.csv")
```

**Task A:** Find average price of tortillas across all 6 states together for the year 2007.

```{r}
#Average price for 2007
avg_price_2007 <- tortilla_prices_data %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>% #Filters for year 2007
  summarise(
    avg_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE) #Gets average of price column and filters missing data
  )
avg_price_2007
  
```

**Task B:** Find the average price of tortillas across all 6 states together for the year 2024.

```{r}
#Average price for 2024
avg_price_2024 <- tortilla_prices_data %>%
  filter(year == 2024) %>% #Filters for year 2024
  summarise(
    avg_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE) #Gets average of price column and filters missing data
  )
avg_price_2024
```

**Task C:** Find the percent change in the average price of tortillas across all 6 states together from the year 2007 to 2024.

```{r}
#Calculate the percent change in the average price from 2007 to 2024
avg_price_percent_change <- ((avg_price_2024$avg_price - avg_price_2007$avg_price) / avg_price_2007$avg_price) * 100
avg_price_percent_change
```

**Task D:** Make a plot that shows the average price of tortillas (across all 6 states together) each year from the years 2007 to 2024.

```{r}
#Average price each year from 2007 to 2024
avg_price_plot <- tortilla_prices_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

#Create the visualization
ggplot(avg_price_plot, 
       aes(x = year,
           y = avg_price)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Average Price",
       title = "Average price of Tortillas each year from 2007 to 2024") +
  theme_minimal() 

```

**Task E:** For the year 2016, provide summary statistics for each of the six states’ price of tortillas. Make a table of the average price of tortillas in each state in 2016. Also make side-by-side boxplots for each state in 2016.

```{r}
#Summary Statistics
summary_statistics <- tortilla_prices_data %>%
  filter(year == 2016) %>% #Filter for year 2016
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    sample_minimum = min(price, na.rm = TRUE), 
    first_quartile = quantile(price, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
    sample_median = median(price, na.rm = TRUE), 
    third_quartile = quantile(price, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE), 
    sample_maximum = max(price, na.rm = TRUE), 
    median_abs_deviation = mad(price, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE), 
    std = sd(price, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

#Display the Summary Statistics in a table
kable(summary_statistics, caption = "Summary Statistics for 2016")

#Table of average price of tortillas in 2016
avg_price_table <- tortilla_prices_data %>%
  filter(year == 2016) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
kable(avg_price_table, caption = "Average Price of Tortillas in 2016")

#Boxplots for each state in 2016
ggplot(tortilla_prices_data %>%
         filter(year == 2016), aes(x = state,
                                   y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    x = "State",
    y = "Price",
    title = "Tortilla Prices by State in 2016",
    caption = "Source: Kaggle Tortilla Dataset"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
  
```

**Task F:** For the state of Nuevo León, make an overlapping plot of the price of tortillas each year from 2007 to 2024 based on store type

```{r}
#Filter data for Nuevo León
nuevo_leon_plot <- tortilla_prices_data %>%
  filter(state == "NuevoLeon") 

# Create overlapping plot
ggplot(nuevo_leon_plot, aes(x = year,
                            y = price,
                            group = storeType,
                            color = storeType)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Price",
    title = "Price of Tortillas each year from 2007 to 2024 by Store Type",
    caption = "Store Types: Mom and Pop Store vs. Big Retail Store"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Task G:** Image of Tortilla

```{r, fig.cap="https://www.laboiteny.com/cdn/shop/articles/Flour_Tortilla_SQ_600x.jpg?v=1660671209"}
#Prints image of a tortilla
include_graphics("/Users/giannadelorenzo/Downloads/STAT 184/Flour_Tortilla_SQ_600x.jpg")
```
